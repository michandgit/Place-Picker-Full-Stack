# **Place Picker** 🌍📍  

## **Overview**  
**Place Picker** is a full-stack web application built with **React.js, Node.js, and Express.js** that allows users to explore and select places dynamically. The application retrieves **JSON-based place data** from the backend and sorts the user's selected places based on their proximity using user location permissions.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Fetch Places from Backend** – Retrieves place data stored in a JSON format.  
✅ **User Location Access** – Requests permission to access the user's current location.  
✅ **Nearest Location Sorting** – Automatically arranges selected places by proximity.  
✅ **Interactive UI** – Built with React.js for a smooth user experience.  
✅ **Lightweight Backend** – Node.js with Express.js handles API requests efficiently.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Data Storage:** JSON  

## **How It Works**  
1. The **frontend requests place data** from the backend.  
2. The user is **prompted to allow location access** for sorting purposes.  
3. **User selects places**, and they are **automatically sorted** by distance.  
4. The **sorted places appear** in the "User Places" section.  




## **Future Enhancements**  
🚀 **Add filtering options** (e.g., restaurants, parks, cafes).  
🚀 **Implement a search feature** to find places quickly.  
🚀 **Enhance sorting with more location-based factors**.
